%% R8VEC_DIRECT_PRODUCT creates a direct product of R8VEC's.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    To explain what is going on here, suppose we had to construct
%    a multidimensional quadrature rule as the product of K rules
%    for 1D quadrature.
%
%    The product rule will be represented as a list of points and weights.
%
%    The J-th item in the product rule will be associated with
%      item J1 of 1D rule 1,
%      item J2 of 1D rule 2, 
%      ..., 
%      item JK of 1D rule K.
%
%    In particular, 
%      X(J) = ( X(1,J1), X(2,J2), ..., X(K,JK))
%    and
%      W(J) = W(1,J1) * W(2,J2) * ... * W(K,JK)
%
%    So we can construct the quadrature rule if we can properly
%    distribute the information in the 1D quadrature rules.
%
%    This routine carries out that task.
%
%    Another way to do this would be to compute, one by one, the
%    set of all possible indices (J1,J2,...,JK), and then index
%    the appropriate information.  An advantage of the method shown
%    here is that you can process the K-th set of information and
%    then discard it.
%
%  Example:
%
%    Rule 1: 
%      Order = 4
%      X(1:4) = ( 1, 2, 3, 4 )
%
%    Rule 2:
%      Order = 3
%      X(1:3) = ( 10, 20, 30 )
%
%    Rule 3:
%      Order = 2
%      X(1:2) = ( 100, 200 )
%
%    Product Rule:
%      Order = 24
%      X(1:24) = 
%        ( 1, 10, 100 )
%        ( 2, 10, 100 )
%        ( 3, 10, 100 )
%        ( 4, 10, 100 )
%        ( 1, 20, 100 )
%        ( 2, 20, 100 )
%        ( 3, 20, 100 )
%        ( 4, 20, 100 )
%        ( 1, 30, 100 )
%        ( 2, 30, 100 )
%        ( 3, 30, 100 )
%        ( 4, 30, 100 )
%        ( 1, 10, 200 )
%        ( 2, 10, 200 )
%        ( 3, 10, 200 )
%        ( 4, 10, 200 )
%        ( 1, 20, 200 )
%        ( 2, 20, 200 )
%        ( 3, 20, 200 )
%        ( 4, 20, 200 )
%        ( 1, 30, 200 )
%        ( 2, 30, 200 )
%        ( 3, 30, 200 )
